  <h1>Hello, This is Faisal F Rafat</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      Welcome to this quiet corner of the web—no noise, just vibes. I’m curious, creative, and quietly ambitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like building things—mostly with no-code, sometimes with low-code, rarely with patience. Been obsessed with how digital stuff works since forever, not just as a user but as someone who likes to poke under the hood and mess around.

    <h2>What I’m Doing Now</h2>
    <p>
      I work as a Program Officer at the <a target="_blank" href="https://bangla.gov.bd">EBLICT Project</a>under <a target="_blank" href="https://dream71.com">Dream71 Bangladesh Ltd.</a>, where my job description basically reads: “do everything.” From paperwork to UI/UX design to testing apps—I jump between tasks like tabs on a busy Chrome window. It’s hectic, but never boring.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the side, I take on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fiverr.com/s/Gz3w972">WordPress gigs</a>-designing, fixing, and keeping sites alive. I also tinker with my own little projects, mostly just to stay sane and keep my brain from getting rusty.

    <h2>A Bit About My Academics</h2>
    <p>
      I studied Civil Engineering at <a target="_blank" href="https://ruet.ac.bd">RUET</a>—though nothing I do now has much to do with bending steel or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375743674_Study_on_Use_of_Recycled_Plastic_Bottle_Chips_as_a_Partial_Replacement_of_Sand_in_Cement-Mortar_Mix">pouring concrete</a>. What I really learned there was how to survive, adapt, and keep going when things get tough. Think of it as a degree in life, disguised as engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a lot of time organizing events and running clubs on campus, which taught me way more about teamwork and chaos management than any textbook. As for the skills I use now? Learned them all from the world’s biggest university: Google.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and I’m currently doing a professional Master’s in Applied Statistics and Data Science from <a target="_blank" href="https://juniv.edu">JU</a>—adding some solid numbers and analytics to the mix.
    </p>

    <h2>Things I'm Good At</h2>
    <p>
      I shoot photos with my cellphone and camera and make them pop with Lightroom. I cut and stitch videos using Premiere Pro. When it comes to design, Figma and Illustrator are my playgrounds. I build WordPress sites, dabble in coding, and even tinker with basic electronics and networking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and I consider myself a great prompt engineer—crafting the right words to get AI to do some magic. Plus, I’m a quick learner who’s always hungry for the next skill.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Do for Fun</h2>
    <p>
      I travel. Mostly solo, mostly on a budget, and usually with no solid plan—just a backpack and a sense of adventure. So far, I’ve wandered through India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, with many more pins to drop on the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love capturing landscapes and street moments along the way, then editing them till they feel just right. Travel keeps my eyes open and my mind clear. It’s how I hit refresh.
    </p>

    <h2>Free Time Shenanigans</h2>
    <p>
      When I’m off the clock, you’ll find me binge-watching movies and YouTube, or fiddling with electronic gadgets—mostly the mysterious “China-made wonders” from AliExpress.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I build things, break things, and sometimes manage to fix them again. Oh, and I try to share those adventures on my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNFNUVYAH9uRYnPUbXcm3uw">YouTube channel</a> for anyone curious enough to watch the chaos unfold.

    <h2>Connect With Me</h2>
    <p>
      For friends and fam, I’m mostly hanging out on <a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.com/fslfrqrft">Facebook</a>. Work-wise, I live on <a target="_blank" href="https://wa.me/+8801734512161">WhatsApp</a>. When I feel like writing, I drop articles on <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@ffrafat">Medium</a>. When a photo feels right, it ends up on <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/fslfrqrft">Instagram</a>. And when I build something that actually works, you’ll probably find it on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ffrafat">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Email is always open — shoot me a message at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ff@rafat.cc">ff@rafat.cc</a>. I’ll probably reply faster than you’d expect.
