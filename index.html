  <h1>Hello, This is Faisal F Rafat</h1>
</section>
  <section>
    <p>
      Welcome to this quiet corner of the web—no noise, just vibes. I’m curious, creative, and quietly ambitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like building things—mostly with no-code, sometimes with low-code, rarely with patience. Been obsessed with how digital stuff works since forever, not just as a user but as someone who likes to poke under the hood and mess around.

    <h2>What I’m Doing Now</h2>
    <p>
      I work as a Program Officer at the <a target="_blank" href="https://bangla.gov.bd">EBLICT Project</a> under <a target="_blank" href="https://dream71.com">Dream71 Bangladesh Ltd.</a>, where my job description basically reads: “do everything.” From paperwork to UI/UX design to testing apps—I jump between tasks like tabs on a busy Chrome window. It’s hectic, but never boring.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the side, I take on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fiverr.com/s/Gz3w972">WordPress gigs</a>-designing, fixing, and keeping sites alive. I also tinker with my own little projects, mostly just to stay sane and keep my brain from getting rusty.

    <h2>A Bit About My Academics</h2>
    <p>
      I studied Civil Engineering at <a target="_blank" href="https://ruet.ac.bd">RUET</a>—though nothing I do now has much to do with bending steel or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375743674_Study_on_Use_of_Recycled_Plastic_Bottle_Chips_as_a_Partial_Replacement_of_Sand_in_Cement-Mortar_Mix">pouring concrete</a>. What I really learned there was how to survive, adapt, and keep going when things get tough. Think of it as a degree in life, disguised as engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a lot of time organizing events and running clubs on campus, which taught me way more about teamwork and chaos management than any textbook. As for the skills I use now? Learned them all from the world’s biggest university: Google.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and I’m currently doing a professional Master’s in Applied Statistics and Data Science from <a target="_blank" href="https://juniv.edu">JU</a>—adding some solid numbers and analytics to the mix.
    </p>

    <h2>Things I'm Good At</h2>
    <p>
      I shoot photos with my cellphone and camera and make them pop with Lightroom. I cut and stitch videos using Premiere Pro. When it comes to design, Figma and Illustrator are my playgrounds. I build WordPress sites, dabble in coding, and even tinker with basic electronics and networking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and I consider myself a great prompt engineer—crafting the right words to get AI to do some magic. Plus, I’m a quick learner who’s always hungry for the next skill.

    <h2>What I Do for Fun</h2>
    <p>
      I travel. Mostly solo, mostly on a budget, and usually with no solid plan—just a backpack and a sense of adventure. So far, I’ve wandered through India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, with many more pins to drop on the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love capturing landscapes and street moments along the way, then editing them till they feel just right. Travel keeps my eyes open and my mind clear. It’s how I hit refresh.

    <h2>Free Time Shenanigans</h2>
    <p>
      When I’m off the clock, you’ll find me binge-watching movies and YouTube, or fiddling with electronic gadgets—mostly the mysterious “China-made wonders” from AliExpress.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I build things, break things, and sometimes manage to fix them again. Oh, and I try to share those adventures on my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNFNUVYAH9uRYnPUbXcm3uw">YouTube channel</a> for anyone curious enough to watch the chaos unfold.

    <h2>Connect With Me</h2>
    <p>
      For friends and fam, I'm mostly hanging out on <a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.com/fslfrqrft">Facebook</a>. Work-wise, I live on <a target="_blank" href="https://wa.me/+8801734512161">WhatsApp</a>. When I feel like writing, I drop articles on <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@ffrafat">Medium</a>. When a photo feels right, it ends up on <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/fslfrqrft">Instagram</a>. And when I build something that actually works, you'll probably find it on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ffrafat">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Email is always open — shoot me a message at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ff@rafat.cc">ff@rafat.cc</a>. I'll probably reply faster than you'd expect.

    <h2>Ham Radio Activity</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not online, you'll find me on the airwaves. I'm an avid ham radio operator and love connecting with fellow radio enthusiasts around the world. Here's my recent activity log:
